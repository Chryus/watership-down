Angular on Rails 4.2.3 app, setup with bower-rails + angular-rails-templates following this tutorial: http://start.jcolemorrison.com/setting-up-an-angularjs-and-rails-4-1-project/. This app uses sprockets v2.12.3, as angular-rails-templates won't support v3. As a workaround you can delete angular-rails-templates and follow these steps to implement templates from scratch with the listen gem: https://github.com/pitr/angular-rails-templates/issues/93#issuecomment-109953596. This app will move to this format next.
