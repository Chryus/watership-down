Angular on Rails 4.2.3 app, setup with bower-rails + angular-rails-templates. This app uses sprockets v2.12.3, as angular-rails-templates won't support v3. As a workaround you can delete angular-rails-templates and follow these steps: https://github.com/pitr/angular-rails-templates/issues/93#issuecomment-109953596. This app will move to this format next.
